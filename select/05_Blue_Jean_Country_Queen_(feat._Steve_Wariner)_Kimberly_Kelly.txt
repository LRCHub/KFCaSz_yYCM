She rolls up to the Continental Club with a Farrah Fawcett smile
Parks on the sidewalk, fresh coat of lip gloss
Struts to the front of the line
Blows a kiss for the cover
Makes the cover band stutter, a real life Barbie doll
Girls are all glaring, boys are all staring, the 1970's called

She's a blue jean country queen
A honky tonk heart attack
Boots to her knees fringe on her sleeves and horns on her Cadillac
Mommas prayer, and daddy's nightmare, made for the neon lights
She's a blue jean country queen looking for a king tonight

Ain't bought a beer since coming in here, the boys take care of that
They all wanna be, the guy that gets to see
The place where she hangs her hat
After long necking and a little two stepping
She leaves 'em with a case of heart burn
She ain't met a cowboy yet, that knows how to handle her

She's a blue jean country queen
A honky tonk heart attack
Boots to her knees fringe on her sleeves and horns on her Cadillac
Mommas prayer, and daddy's nightmare, made for the neon lights
She's a blue jean country queen looking for a king tonight

Look out boys!
C'mon Steve!

Blue jean country queen
A honky tonk heart attack
Boots to her knees fringe on her sleeves and horns on her Cadillac
Mommas prayer, and daddy's nightmare, made for the neon lights
She's a blue jean country queen looking for a king tonight
Blue jean country queen looking for a king tonight
