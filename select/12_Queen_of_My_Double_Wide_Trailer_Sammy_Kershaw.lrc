[00:11.95] Well, I met her out at Murphy's restaurant
[00:16.59] She said, she was fresh from the farm
[00:20.12] And I remember thinkin' for a country girl
[00:23.48] That she went pretty well armed
[00:26.23] We sat there talkin' by the lobster tank
[00:30.08] I ordered her a slow gin fizz
[00:33.65] And when them chicken fried steaks arrived
[00:36.64] She said, I like living like this
[00:41.07] So I made her the queen of my double wide trailer
[00:44.77] With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
[00:50.35] Now she's run off and I've got to trail her
[00:54.36] Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck
[01:06.46] Well, a few nights later I run into her
[01:16.26] With some stranger on a park bench
[01:19.46] She said, he rebuilds engines and his name is Earl
[01:22.92] He's the Charlie Daniels of the torque wrench
[01:26.19] I whispered, honey let's just go on home
[01:29.83] And have some onion rings and watch TV
[01:32.85] And as I walked her to the truck
[01:36.84] Earl was cryin' don't you leave me
[01:40.98] I told him
[01:41.73] This is the queen of my double wide trailer
[01:44.82] With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
[01:47.84] Sometimes she runs and I've got to trail her
[01:53.90] Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck
[01:59.38] I said, this is the queen of my double wide trailer
[02:21.47] With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
[02:25.52] Sometimes she runs and I've got to trail her
[02:30.63] Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck
[02:34.92] I said, this is the queen of my double wide trailer
[02:39.91] With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
[02:44.09] Sometimes she runs and I've got to trail her
[02:48.91] Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck
[02:53.93] She's the queen
[03:04.37] She's the queen
